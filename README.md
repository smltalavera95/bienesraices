# Project Bienes Raices
<h2>Project made in just HTML & CSS </h2>
<p>This a practice of one of the course online that I am taking. It's so easy to make it, but it helps to refresh some good practices in web development</p>
<h2>What is about?</h2>
<p>It's about sell properties or houses, with 4 main pages: Home, About, Ads of Properties, Blog and Contact</p>
<blockqoute>Still under construction... I have to make the Ads page, Blog and Contact and make it responsive</blockquote>
